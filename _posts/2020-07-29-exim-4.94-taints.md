Starting with [Exim 4.94](https://git.exim.org/exim.git/blob/f1e494e0021f2efbc346a24727b8ebc66733e4b2:/src/README.UPDATING#l29) 
there's some breaking changes; the docs say it the best:


```
Some Transports now refuse to use tainted data in constructing their delivery
location; this WILL BREAK configurations which are not updated accordingly.
```


So if you are seeing `Tainted filename for search` or something similar in 
your logs then that's the issue.


# My Setup
For me personally I was using `$domain` and `$local_part` in a router to first 
find a `$domain` specific aliases file, then was looking up the destination 
using `$local_part`.


## My Fix
`$domain` -> `$domain_data`

`$local_part` -> `$local_part_data`



It's worth looking at the [docs](https://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/ch-string_expansions.html) 
to get some ideas about what expansion variables there are.


Hope that helps :)
